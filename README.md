This variable font project's purpose was to learn how to design a website from a coded base and allow your own design to come through. The main subject was variable fonts, using them for emphasis effect or importance. These can also become live fonts when using CSS. AS you can see in the hero section, the word "Condor" stretches out and then shrinks back in to show the variety of width and weight within this font.
While learning CSS and html, I used CSS grid with some assistance for the first time. I also created graphics in figma, for the background. Along the conversation of content, I used ChatGPT for the history but did some personal research on the Art Deco style to help with color palette and industrial look.
This was my first time coding a full site with HTML and CSS, as I've done a portfolio with the information but very brief design, similar to early days site designs(plain and dull).
